# Comma-separated list of nodes
builders=zin2,moscato2

# Currently, build nodes are tied to a specific bioconductor version, via various
# configuration files.  For example:
# - zin1 will only build artifacts against Bioconductor 3.2
# - zin2 will only build artifacts against Bioconductor 3.3
#
# The configuration was designed to be hierarchical, but over time has created a lot
# to maintain in the git repository.  For instance, every node, and every version has
# something like this (below example on zin2, repeats for all versions and nodes) :
#   - /home/biocbuild/BBS/3.3/config.sh
#   - /home/biocbuild/BBS/3.3/bioc/config.sh
#   - /home/biocbuild/BBS/3.3/bioc/zin2/config.sh
#
# We've wound up with multiple config files that have similar intention :
#   - https://github.com/Bioconductor/BBS/blob/feature/migrate_back_to_hutch/3.3/config.sh#L25-L30
#   - https://github.com/Bioconductor/BBS/blob/feature/migrate_back_to_hutch/3.2/config.sh#L25-L30
#   - https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioconductor.org/blob/master/config.yaml
#
# Until we create a mechanism to appropriately configure these things in a more
# dynamic fashion, we'll need to define some properties manually.  Since the SPB
# only runs in "devel" (Bioconductor 3.3 as of 2015-Dec-09), we configure the SPB
# according to the 3.3 configuration for a given host.
#
# In applying recent changes to the SPB, I wanted to document this, to simplify
# installation and so that we have highlighted this for discussions on refactoring
# the configuration of hosts / software.
#
# Below, you'll see properties that are documented with an example value, and the files
# that control the setting of the value.  Imagine a property called "bbs.ssh.cmd".  The
# property was previously known by an environment variable "BBS_SSH_CMD".  To document
# the property, the following model is used.  First, we cite the files that are 
# used (in order) to set that value.  Then, show an example value, then we
